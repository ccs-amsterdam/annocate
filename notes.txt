Two common modes for creating jobs:

Advanced version creates multiple jobs at once. 
- units
- jobs[]: 
  - name: unitset
  - name: layout
  - name: codebook

Simple version creates a single job.
- units
- layout
- codebook



!! Split it all up: separate unitset, layout and codebook
Then in preview mode, the top bar represents the job. Here you select each component.
In the right column in review mode, you have tabs for each component. 
If a component is used in other jobs as well, you get a notification that changing it also changes the other job


The relation between units and layout is tested at job level. 

Important to give good instruction about when to use projects and when to use jobs.
A project should ideally have only one type of data. 
Different layouts are primarily intended to offer different ways of displaying the same data.
The primary use case would be experiments. 

You can also use layouts to combine different datatypes in the same project.
You then need to make sure that the layout matches the type of the unitset its matched with in the job.
