Make sub table for annotations in DB

composite primary key:

- id (as created by client)
- unitAnnotationId
- annotation

When posting annotations, just post the ones for current variable, as an upsert using the unique IDs.

The encrypted session token doesn't contain the validation data, but just a boolean for whether or not the variable should be validated. If so, fetch the validation data from the DB.

Include "done" field in annotation. Set this to true if the annotator confirmed submitting the variable (in case of multi code annotations).

Now always calculate the variablestatuses from scratch on update. Make it so that it stops if a variable is not yet answered (which can happen if codebook changed). Then recalculate once answered, so it should automatically skip over gaps.
